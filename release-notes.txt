Overall

Progress

Dsin (Correcting sinusoidal distortion from resonant scanner)

Secondary modalities (Combining signals from multiple cameras)

ARFS (Automated reference frame selection - for use in registration and averaging)
• Changed rejection criterion from mean-3SD to mean-SD to enforce a more strict rejection of low-quality frames
• Bug fix in contrast-based frame rejection (indexing error which was selection wrong frames; same error was not present in mean intensity, sharpness, or similarity metrics)
• Bug fix (perhaps the dumbest one yet) - after both contrast, sharpness, and similarity-based rejections, the frames data structure was not updated to reflect the rejected frames.

NEST (Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) parameter estimation)

DeMotion (Strip-based registration and averaging)
• Included message box warning about registration failures
• Changed the minimum height requirement for a successfully registered image from 450 to 400; for ROI purposes, this should be sufficient, for montaging purposes, any height deficiency can now be dealt with by finding a reference frame more superior or inferior to the original reference frame.

EMR (Eye motion removal)

Trim (Removes transparent layer from images output by EMR)

Automontager (Automatically montages images; automatically reprocesses videos to fill in any gaps where the automontager is unable to connect images)
• Bug fix: reading coordinate files
• Bug fix: incorrect y-axis indexing for automontager feedback step
• Enhancement: filter out frames with low PCC before reprocessing to connect disjoints in montage
