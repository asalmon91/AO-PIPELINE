# AO-PIPELINE
Contains a quick-and-dirty "live" mode for running during acquisition to facilitate complete montage collection and a more robust but slow "full" mode for producing analysis-ready montages.

The current state is pretty raw and rigid, the goal is to become much more modular so that processing modules can be swapped out with the development of proper adapters.

Current Requirements:
For both modes:
Python 2.7, preferably at C:\Python27
DubraLab software
Matlab â‰¥ 2017

For "live" mode (can easily be disabled in the GUI):
Python 3.7, preferably at C:\Python37

Adobe Photoshop CS6, preferably at C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)
